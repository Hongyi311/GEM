# Your task: Evaluate the alignment and quality of a generated ECG interpretation by comparing it to a ground truth clinician’s interpretation.

## Evaluation Criteria:

    1. DiagnosisAccuracy: Evaluates whether the generated diagnosis is correct, specific, and supported by ECG findings.
        - Scoring
            +2 per diagnosis: Each correctly identified key diagnosis with supporting ECG features.
            +1 per diagnosis: Each mostly correct diagnosis but lacking key supporting details.
            +0 per diagnosis: Each incorrect or vague diagnosis not supported by ECG features.

    2. AnalysisCompleteness: Checks if all key ECG components (rhythm, intervals, waveforms, and lead-specific findings) are discussed.
        - Scoring
            +1 per feature: For each correctly addressed key ECG feature (e.g., rhythm, PR interval, QRS duration, ST segment, T wave morphology).
            +0 per missing feature: For each key feature omitted or inaccurately described.

    3. AnalysisRelevance: Assesses whether each provided explanation directly supports the diagnosis.
        - Scoring
            +2 per feature or per lead: Each point that strongly supports the diagnosis with clear ECG evidence.
            +1 per feature or per lead: Some points are relevant but not fully justified.
            +0: Includes unrelated or misleading explanations.
            
    4. LeadAssessmentCoverage: Evaluates how many of the 12 ECG leads are analyzed.
        - Scoring
            +1 per lead: For each lead adequately assessed.
            +0 per missing lead: For each lead omitted or inaccurately described.

    5. LeadAssessmentAccuracy: Checks if the described lead findings (e.g., QRS, ST, T waves, amplitude, intervals, ST segments) match standard ECG interpretation.
        - Scoring 
            +2 per lead: Findings closely match expected values.
            +1 per lead: Findings are somewhat accurate but have minor inconsistencies.
            +0 per lead: Findings contradict ECG norms.

    6. GroundedECGUnderstanding: Determines if the interpretation references actual ECG features (e.g., QRS amplitude, PR interval) instead of generic terms.
        - Scoring (0-100)
            100: ECG findings are comprehensively cited, linked to diagnoses, and cover all relevant ECG features.
            80: ECG findings are explicitly cited and linked to diagnoses.
            50: Some ECG references exist but are incomplete.
            0: Lacks specific waveform references.

    7. EvidenceBasedReasoning: Evaluates whether the diagnosis follows logical, evidence-supported steps.
        - Scoring (0-100)
            100: Findings logically progress to diagnosis with thorough and clear justifications covering all necessary steps.
            80: Findings logically progress to diagnosis with clear justifications.
            50: Some reasoning exists but lacks complete step-by-step analysis.
            0: Reasoning is unclear or not derived from ECG findings.

    8. RealisticDiagnosticProcess: Assesses if the model mimics how a clinician interprets an ECG, considering all relevant factors.
        - Scoring (0-100)
            100: The analysis follows a structured clinical approach and considers all relevant clinical factors.
            80: The analysis follows a structured clinical approach.
            50: Some clinical reasoning is present but incomplete.
            0: The approach lacks structured clinical reasoning.

    NOTE: Each score must be calculated based on strict criteria to ensure objective evaluation.
